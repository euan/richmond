Richmond
========

Connecting the python-ssmi client to AMQP to allow for backends to scale more easily. 

If you're wondering about the name. Apparently Richmond has is a great city for commuters, few traffic problems. Seemed like a good name for a high-traffic message bus application.

Getting started
---------------

run `source setup-vritualenv.source` to do the virtualenv hoopla and install the requirements from `requirements.pip`.
